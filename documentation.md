# Learnt Concepts
# Bill Chakairu
1. I learned how to use conventional methods to create issues, milestones, and commits effectively.
2. I gained a deeper understanding of collaboration workflows using pull requests, including how to name them clearly and meaningfully.
3. I explored the GitHub Project Board as a tool for organizing and tracking progress.
4. Additionally, I learned the differences between Git merge, Git rebase, and Git squash-and-merge strategies, and how each impacts the project history.
